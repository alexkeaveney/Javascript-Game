        <ul>
            <li>The cards are dealt out evenly. Remainders are put in the pile.</li>
            <li>The game starts from the left of the first person in the lobby.</li>
            <li>The first card is Ace. The player must put down 1 - 4 cards face down claiming them all to be Aces or skip their turn. None of them actually have to be Aces.</li>
            <li>The other players are then given the chance to call 'cheat' on the player if they don't believe the player has that many Aces.</li>
            <li>The cards are then flipped around. If the player is caught lying they must take all of the cards from the pile.</li>
            <li>If the player told the truth the player(s) that called cheat on them must take all of the cards in the pile.</li>
            <li>The next card will be 2. The player to the left must claim 2's or skip their turn.</li>
            <li>This goes on 3, 4, 5 .. King and then back to Ace.</li>
            <li>The object of the game is to get rid of all your cards. </li>
        </ul>
